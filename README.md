Phase 1: Setup & Data Collection
[ ] Set up Python virtual environment
[ ] Install dependencies (OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.)
[ ] Create scripts to capture and label hand images/videos
[ ] Collect and annotate dataset for hand landmarks
Phase 2: Model Development
[ ] Preprocess collected data (resize, normalize, augment, etc.)
[ ] Design and implement a custom hand landmark detection model
[ ] Train the model and evaluate performance
[ ] Save trained model checkpoints
Phase 3: Inference & Gesture Recognition
[ ] Write inference script to run model on webcam feed
[ ] Implement gesture recognition logic (e.g., swipe, pinch, etc.)
Phase 4: Mouse Control Integration
[ ] Integrate PyAutoGUI to control mouse based on recognized gestures
[ ] Test and refine gesture-to-mouse mapping
Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
[ ] Write unit and integration tests
[ ] Document code and usage in README.md
[ ] Test on both Mac and Windows
Phase 6: Version Control & Collaboration
[ ] Initialize git repository
[ ] Create .gitignore (ignore data, models, etc.)
[ ] Push to GitHub
